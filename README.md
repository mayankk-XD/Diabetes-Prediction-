# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Pima Indians Dataset (Flask App)

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on key medical attributes using **Logistic Regression**, with a **Flask-based web interface** for easy interaction.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and blood pressure â€” and provide a simple web UI for users to enter their details and see predictions instantly.

## ðŸ“š Key Concepts
- **Logistic Regression** for binary classification  
- **Feature Importance** to identify key predictors  
- **Flask** for building a simple web-based user interface  
- **Data Preprocessing** (handling missing values, scaling)  
- **Model Evaluation** using accuracy, confusion matrix

## ðŸ§  Dataset
- **Name:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)  
- **Description:** The dataset contains diagnostic measurements for 768 women, including glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, and more.  
- **Target Variable:** `Outcome` (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)

---

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance (Summary)
- **Accuracy:** 0.74  
- **Non-diabetic (0):** Precision 0.85, Recall 0.73  
- **Diabetic (1):** Precision 0.61, Recall 0.76
